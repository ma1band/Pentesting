## "$1" represents the second argument (aka argument 1) in the command. For example, in ./sweep.sh 192.168.4, 192.168.4 is argument 1, ./sweep.sh is argument 0
## ampersand(&) allows the script to thread processes
## for this script to work, chmod the file to give it execute permissions and thien run ./ipsweep with an ip address up to the end of the 3rd octet. For example, ./ipsweep 192.168.4
## when you run it, save to a file then run "for ip in $(cat NAME_OF_SAVED_FILE.txt); do nmap $ip; done"
